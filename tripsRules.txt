*****Rules of the game*****
Trips is a dice game for 2-15 players. The object of the game is to have the
lowest score after taking a turn up to roll. Traditionally the game is played
for $$$, with each player adding a designated sum of money to the pot before
being allowed to roll for who chooses first to roll, and the winner takes all.
Gambling and superstitition can go hand in hand, and the choice of who gets to
choose who rolls first is no different. Unless a player 'Shoots the moon', when
you roll has no effect on the outcome of the game.

~How to play~

First:
All the players in the pot will enter their names in clockwise order.
The first person to enter does not matter as the list will be reordered by the
player who wins the initial rolloff.

Second:
One dice will be rolled for each player, and the lowest gets to select who will
roll first. The game will resolve ties until there is a clear winner.

Third:
Each player will take a turn rolling the dice in order.
Players will roll 5 dice to start. Any roll of 3 is worth 0 points, all other dice
are worth their face value. A player must select at least one dice from their roll
to keep, with no limit on how many dice they keep from a roll. Following this formula
the player will reroll the remaining dice until they have selected 5 dice, and the
next player will take their turn.

Shooting the moon:
If at any point a player has rolled 5 or selected to keep 5 dice with a value of 6
(30 points total) counts as 'shooting the moon', and the player wins immediately,
regardless if there are players remaining in the pool to roll.

Resolving a tie:
If two or more players tie for the lowest score, they will reroll 5 dice in the
typical fashion until only one player wins. Often this coincides with the players
adding more funds to the pot, but this is not a requirement.
